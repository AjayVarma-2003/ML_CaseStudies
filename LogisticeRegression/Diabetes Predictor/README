Dependencies :-
    Install the required python packages before running the project:
        pip install pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, joblib

Dataset Information :-
    Features(8) :-
        1. Pregnancies
        2. Glucose
        3. BloodPressure
        4. SkinThickness
        5. Insulin
        6. BMI
        7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction
        8. Age
    Target(Outcome) :-
        1. 0 = Dibetic
        2. 1 = Non Diabetic

Workflow :-
    Data Preparation :-
        1. If dataset is in .raw format then convert to .csv with headers.
        2. Replace missing values if any.
        3. Ensure numeric type conversion for all feature columns.
    Train-Test split :-
        1. Split into 80% train and 20% test.
    Pipeline Construction :-
        1. Step 1 = Use standard scalar for standardizing feature values.
        2. Step 2 = LogisticRegression with max iteraion of 1000.
    Model Training and Evaluation :-
        1. Metrics - accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report
        2. Used to calculate accuracy of model.
    Model Saving and Loading :-
        1. Save the model with Joblib.
        2. Load model for future predictions without retraining.

Running the project :-
    1. Prepare CSV and load CSV
    2. Train and Evaluate Model
    3. Visualization :-
        1> Confusion matrix with Matplotlib
    4. Model Storage :-
        1> model saved as DiabetesPredictorLogistic.joblib
        2> Can be loaded anytime for predection without retraining.

Sample Prediction :-
    sample = X_test.iloc[[0]]
    pred = model.predict(sample)
    print("Prediction is : ", pred[0])
